                <p className="mb-4">
                    Bases and hydroxides of metals consist of oxides and hydroxides of metals. Metallic oxides are compounds formed by the reaction of metals with oxygen. For example, sodium reacts with oxygen to produce sodium oxide (Na₂O). Similarly, magnesium on ignition in air burns producing magnesium oxide (MgO).

                    <strong>Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide</strong>

                    4Na + O₂ → 2 Na₂O
                    <br />
                    2 Mg + O₂ → 2 MgO

                    When metal oxides dissolve in water, they result in metal cations and oxide ions in aqueous solution. Because oxide ions are unstable in water, they immediately accept protons from water molecules and become hydroxide ions, and the water molecules also become hydroxide ions. Which species is the proton donor in this reaction?

                    <br />
                    MgO + H₂O → Mg(OH)₂
                    <br />
                    Na₂O + H₂O → 2 NaOH
                    <br />
                    CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂

                    Most metal oxides and hydroxides are very basic in nature. They show the characteristic properties of bases. However, some metal oxides and hydroxides do not dissolve in water but behave in chemical reactions like both acids and bases. Such metal oxides and hydroxides are called amphoteric oxides and hydroxides, respectively. For example, aluminium oxide (Al₂O₃), aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), zinc oxide (ZnO), and zinc hydroxide (Zn(OH)₂).
