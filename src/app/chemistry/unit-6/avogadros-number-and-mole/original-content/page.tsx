      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">6.3 CHEMICAL FORMULA AND NAME OF BINARY IONIC COMPOUNDS</h2>

      <p className="mb-2">
        A binary ionic compound is composed of mono-atomic metal cations and mono-atomic non-metal anions. To write the name of an ionic compound, the cation is named first followed by the name of anion. How do you name cations and anions? The name of the cation is the same as the name of the metal, but in the name of mono-atomic anion, the suffix ide is added to the root name of the element. For example, sodium chloride, magnesium oxide, aluminium nitride, etc.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        The following steps are used to write the chemical formula of a binary ionic compound.
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mb-2">
        <li>Write the symbols for the cation first and then the symbols for the anion and their charges.</li>
        <li>Balance the charges on the cations and anions using the smallest coefficient. The total charge on the cation must equal the total charge on the anion because an ionic compound is neutral.</li>
        <li>Write coefficients as subscripts for each ion.</li>
        <li>Write the formula of the ionic compound. For this, leave out all the charge subscripts which are 1.</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-2">
        For example, the chemical formula of sodium chloride is written as follows;
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded">
        Na Cl <sup>+1</sup> <sup>-1</sup> → NaCl
      </pre>

      <p className="mb-2">
        Example 2, the chemical formula of aluminium oxide is written as follows;
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded">
        Al O <sup>+3</sup> <sup>-2</sup> → Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
      </pre>

      <p className="mb-2">
        How do you count your shoes? Since the shoes come in pairs, you&apos;ll probably count them in pairs rather than individually. Likewise, eggs, oranges, etc. are counted in the dozens, but paper with the ream. So the unit of counting depends on what you are counting. Chemists also use a practical unit for counting atoms, molecules and ions. They use a counting unit called mole to measure the amount of a substance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        A mole is an amount of a substance that contains 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> particles of that substance. This experimentally determined number is known as Avogadro&apos;s number. It is represented by N<sub>A</sub>. Just as a dozen eggs represent twelve eggs, a ream of paper represent 500 papers, a mole of a substance represents 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> representative particles of a substance. For example a mole of carbon is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. A mole of sulfur is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms. A mole of water is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules.

      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        Entire population cannot count 1 mole of coins in a year. They need about one million years to count them. So, when counting a pile of coins, it would not be convenient to count them one by one. The concept of mole has given a very simple method to count large number of items. Mole is not only a number but also represents a definite amount of a substance. Just as 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> carbon atoms weigh 12 g, 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> coins will also have a definite mass. So an easy way is to weigh them. If you know the mass of one coin, you can count them by weighing.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        The mass of one mole of a substance is called molar mass. What are the molar masses of carbon and sulfur? The term representative particles in a substance are atoms, molecules, formula units or ions. For instance, water exists as molecules, hydrogen exists as H<sub>2</sub> molecules, so one mole of hydrogen contains 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules, carbon exists as atoms so 1 mole of carbon contains 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> atoms.
