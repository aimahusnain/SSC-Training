      <p className="mb-2">
        The structural formula of a compound shows the arrangement of atoms present in it, while the molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element. For example, the structural formula of n-Butane is CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>3</sub> and its molecular formula is C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        To write the molecular formula of a compound from its structural formula, follow these steps:
        <br />
        <strong>1.</strong> Identify different types of elements present in the structural formula.
        <br />
        <strong>2.</strong> Write symbols of these elements side by side in a line.
        <br />
        <strong>3.</strong> Count the number of atoms of each element from the structural formula.
        <br />
        <strong>4.</strong> Show this number of atoms as subscripts of the symbol of the corresponding element.
