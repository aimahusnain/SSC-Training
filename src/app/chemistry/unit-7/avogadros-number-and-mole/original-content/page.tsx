      <p className="mb-4">
        How do you count your shoes? Since the shoes come in pairs, you&apos;ll probably count them in pairs rather than individually. Similarly, eggs come in dozens and paper in reams. Chemists use a practical unit for counting atoms, molecules, and ions called the mole.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A mole is an amount of a substance that contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) particles of that substance, known as Avogadro&apos;s number (Nₐ). Just as a dozen represents twelve items, a mole represents \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) representative particles. For example, a mole of carbon contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) atoms, and a mole of water contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Examples:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>A mole of S-atoms = \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) S-atoms</li>
        <li>A mole of C-atoms = \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) C-atoms</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Does a dozen eggs have the same mass as a dozen bananas? Does a mole of carbon atoms have a different mass than a mole of sulfur atoms? The mole helps to simplify these comparisons.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Size of the Mole</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Counting a mole of items like coins is impractical, as it would take an enormous amount of time. The concept of the mole allows us to count large numbers of items conveniently. For instance, if you know the mass of a coin, you can count them by weighing.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The mass of one mole of a substance is called molar mass. For example:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of C-atoms = 12 g</li>
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of Na-atoms = 23 g</li>
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of Zn-atoms = 63.54 g</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Gram Atomic Mass, Gram Molecular Mass, and Gram Formula Mass</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The mass of 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> S-atoms or C-atoms is crucial for calculations:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of S-atoms = 32.1 g</li>
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of C-atoms = 12.0 g</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The gram atomic mass is the atomic mass expressed in grams, representing one mole of atoms. For instance:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Gram atomic mass of C = 12 g</li>
        <li>Gram atomic mass of S = 32.1 g</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Differences in Mass</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If each sample contains one mole of atoms, different elements have different masses due to their atomic masses:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of water molecules = 18.016 g</li>
        <li>Mass of 1 mole of glucose molecules = 180.096 g</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Molar Masses</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The term &quot;molar mass&quot; can refer to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Gram atomic mass: Mass of one mole of atoms (e.g., C = 12 g)</li>
        <li>Gram molecular mass: Mass of one mole of molecules (e.g., H₂O = 18.016 g)</li>
        <li>Gram formula mass: Mass of one mole of formula units (e.g., NaCl = 58.5 g)</li>
      </ul>
