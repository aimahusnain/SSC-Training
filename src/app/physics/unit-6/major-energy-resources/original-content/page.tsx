            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">6.3 Major Energy Resources</h1>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                The progress in science and technology has propelled society from a time when human strength was the primary source of energy, to a time where various forms of energy are harnessed.
                However, in every conversion of energy, there is always a loss of useful energy. It is evident that society cannot persistently consume increasing amounts of energy without taking into account the needs of future generations.
                The forthcoming challenge lies in the development of energy sources and processes that are sustainable. A sustainable resource is one that does not diminish over time and does not harm the delicate biosphere of the Earth, while still meeting the energy requirements of society.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                On this classification, the energy resources are divided into two groups: renewable and non-renewable.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Non-Renewable Energy Resources</h2>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Non-renewable energy resources are limited and cannot be replaced naturally in a short time. Most of the energy we use comes from non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and petroleum.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.1 Fossil Fuels</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Fossil fuels are the remains of million-year-old plant life (now coal) or aquatic animal life (now gasoline and natural gas). Chemical energy stored in fossil fuels is obtained through a process called combustion.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.2 Nuclear Fuel</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Nuclear energy is often considered a nonrenewable energy source, even though nuclear energy itself is renewable. The material used in nuclear power plants, such as uranium, is not renewable. Nuclear power plants harness the energy in the nucleus of an atom through nuclear fission, where the atom&apos;s nucleus splits.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.3 Biomass Fuel</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Biomass refers to material that provides bioenergy. The energy contained in biomass comes from the sun, as plants capture sunlight through photosynthesis and convert it into chemical energy, specifically carbohydrates.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.4 Hydro Electric Resources</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Hydroelectric generation is the process of using the gravitational potential energy of water to generate electric energy. The force of gravity pulls the water down, giving it a lot of kinetic energy.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.5 Solar Radiation</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                The energy from direct sunlight can be used to produce electricity. Today, solar cells are used to power everything from calculators and watches to small cities.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.6 Geothermal Resources</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Geothermal energy comes from the Earth&apos;s core and is formed by the trapped energy from billions of years ago and the heat produced by decaying radioactive elements.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.7 Wind</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                The kinetic energy of the wind can be used to turn turbines, which in turn produce electricity. Wind turbines are the main technology used to capture wind energy.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.8 Waves in the Sea</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                Wave energy, also called ocean wave energy, is obtained from the movement of surface waves on the ocean. Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are devices created to capture the kinetic energy of these waves.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6.3.9 Tides</h3>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                The gravitational force exerted by the moon as it orbits the Earth leads to the formation of bulges in the oceans, both closest and farthest from the moon. These bulges, known as tides, occur twice a day as our planet completes one full rotation on its axis within a 24-hour period.
            </p>

            <div className="mt-8 border-t border-gray-200 pt-4">
                <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">For Your Information</h4>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Perpetual motion is the motion of bodies that continues forever in an unperturbed system. A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work infinitely without an external energy source.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    This kind of machine is impossible, as it would violate either the first or second law of thermodynamics, or both.
